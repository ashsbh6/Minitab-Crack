Features of Minitab:


Discover
Regardless of statistical background, Minitab can empower all parts of an organization to predict better outcomes, design better products, and improve processes to generate higher revenues and reduce costs. Only Minitab offers a unique, integrated approach by providing software and services that drive business excellence now from anywhere thanks to the cloud. Key statistical tests include t-tests, one and two proportions, normality tests, chi-square, and equivalence tests.

Predict
Access modern data analysis and explore your data even further with our advanced analytics and open-source integration. Skillfully predict, compare alternatives, and forecast your business with ease using our revolutionary predictive analytics techniques. Use classical methods in Minitab Statistical Software, integrate with open-source languages R or Python, or boost your capabilities further with machine learning algorithms like Classification and Regression Trees (CART®) or TreeNet® and Random Forests®, now available in Minitab’s Predictive Analytics Module.

Achieve
Seeing is believing. Visualizations can help communicate your findings and achievements through correlograms, binned scatterplots, bubble plots, boxplots, dotplots, histograms, heatmaps, parallel plots, time series plots, and more. Graphs seamlessly update as data changes and our cloud-enabled web app allows for secure analysis sharing with lightning speed.
